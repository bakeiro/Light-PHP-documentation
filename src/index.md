# Light-PHP

### Introduction

`Light-php` it's a really simple yet powerful framework which makes possible to start working without reading massive documentations, so you can focus in the application development and you can understand how the framework works thanks to it's easy MVC structure.  

Yet it looks simple, this project follows the `PSR-0`, `PSR-1` and `PSR-4` standards, good coding practices, MVC structure, dependency injection, CI with github actions and much more!, so this implements the recommended way to develop apps instead of create an "alternative" way to develop apps.
