### Introduction

`Light-PHP` it's a Micro PHP framework easy to understand, to read and modify!  
The target it's to create a PHP framework which makes possible start working without reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks.  
  
This framework comes with a sample website including all the basic things (`login`, `database structure`, `session management`, `navbar`, `admin panel`, `framework css`...).  
So if you start a project you don't have to start from the beginning, just start adapting your project to the sample site so a part of work is done!
